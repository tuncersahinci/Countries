# Countries

The application lists countries parsed from [GeoDB Cities API](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/ "GeoDB Cities API") and lets the user see the details of countries, favorite/unfavorite them and see the favorited countries in another view.

The application was written with SwiftUI, on XCode 13.2.1, and uses [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage "SDWebImage") and [SDWebImageSVGCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSVGCoder "SDWebImageSVGCoder") as dependencies.

## Requirements
